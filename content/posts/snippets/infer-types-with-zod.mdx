This is from [Matt Pocock's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBk4nV7q6-w) appearance on the [VSCode Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCs5Y5_7XK8HLDX0SLNwkd3w).

```TypeScript
import { z } from 'zod'

const Data = z.object({
   id: z.string()
   name: z.string()
})

type DataType = z.infer(typeof Data)

fetch('/something')
   .then((res) => res.json())
   .then((result) => {
      const data = Data.parse(result)
   })
```

This will first validate the incoming data using Zod. A great first step if you're working with a third party API that you can't fully trust. After that, use the `z.infer` to infer types from your validation object. You can now use `DataType` as your types for that response.
