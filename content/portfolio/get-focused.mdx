excerpt: Get Focused is a project born out of my previous use of the Productivity Planner. I've re-imagined it as a webapp, with the same flow and approach as the written journal. The app is mostly about displaying, interacting with and loading data via forms. Built using the new React framework Remix, a framework that embraces web APIs, it allowed me to work with forms easily and effectively.

## Get Focused

For some time I used a product called The Productivity Planner. This planner featured a weekly planner where you would outline the large tasks you need to do, a daily planner to focus on the tasks for each day and then a weekly review. The daily planner, in particular, helped me. I could worry about the things I needed to finish in a day and not worry about large task list.

Get Focused is a digital re-imagining of this product. It features similar weekly planners, daily planners and weekly reviews, while also offering tracking for how you feel day-to-day, if you exercised and a rating for how productive you were. Its been really interesting considering how to provide a similar experience in a digital product, while also trying to have a smooth and fun user experience.
