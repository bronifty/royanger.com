<Quote author="Co.Lab Mmission Statement">
   Technology impacts a global audience - all the more value for the industry to
   be made up of people from different backgrounds, each bringing their unique
   perspectives and lived experiences to the table. And this is not a wildly
   adopted mindsetâ€¦ just yet. Co.Lab will help us get there by giving people
   from all walks of life the real-world, practical experience to confidently
   break into (and thrive within) the tech industry. We want to spark action,
   enable folks to learn by doing, and celebrate achievements as a true
   collective.{' '}

## How was it built?

The app features a frontend built with React, react-router, redux-toolkit and react-query. The frontend connects to a Node Express API, which provides authentication services via Passport and connects to a Postgres database. Most of the API routes are handled via a GraphQL endpoint. The API also connects to the Rainforest API, which allows the API to query Amazon product listings to build recommendations for the user.
