## Frontend and Libraries

When it comes to Front End Development, I love React. I've been learning and switching to it over the last 8 months. It has been nothing short of a breath of fresh air coming from WordPress and PHP, and I definitely love the change of pace.

## APIs and Backend

APIs and Serverless Functions are the backbone of React apps, letting them perform their magic. Whether it is a full Node and Express based API, Serverless Functions or testing with Postman, I can work with APIs and tailor them to the project needs.

## Databases

SQL based databases are definitely more my bread and butter, having spent some time working with MySQL while doing WordPress development. I've moved to using PostgresSQL in most projects. I used MongoDB, Firebase and even FaunaDB on projects.

## Tools and Other Good Stuff

Tailwind CSS is awesome, and I love using it on projects. I've also used Material UI and Bootstrap/React Bootstrap. I've been learning TypeScript, and in fact this site was by first foray into using Ts on a project. Docker is a great tool for building and deploying projects while working with a team and different environments.
