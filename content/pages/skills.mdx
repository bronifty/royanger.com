## Frontend Development and Libraries

When it comes to Front End Development, I love [React](https://reactjs.org/). I started learning it a little over a year ago. It has been nothing short of a breath of fresh air coming from [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/) and [PHP](https://www.php.net/), and I'm enjoying the change of pace.

Over the course of learning React, I've worked with many common tools in the ecosystem. I've built sites with Redux and [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/) and managed routes with [React Router](https://reactrouterdotcom.fly.dev/docs/en/v6). I've built apps that connect with an API, whether that's one I wrote for the app itself or a 3rd party. I've used [fetch](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API/Using_Fetch), [axios](https://axios-http.com/) and [React Query](https://react-query.tanstack.com/).

Like, I image, most of us who have learned React somewhat recently I started with [create-react-app](https://create-react-app.dev/). With later projects I've worked with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and [Remix](https://remix.run/). Using both I've explored Server Side Rendering and Static Site Generation (this site was build with Next.js and SSG).

My most recent projects are written in [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/). I regret not learning TypeScript sooner, but I am definitely enjoying the challenge and the results of working with TS over plain JS.

## APIs, Backends and Databases

APIs and Serverless Functions are the backbone of React apps, letting them perform their magic. Whether it is a full [Node](https://nodejs.dev/) and [Express](https://expressjs.com/) based API, Serverless Functions or testing with [Postman](https://www.postman.com/), I can work with APIs and tailor them to the project needs.

SQL based databases are definitely more my bread and butter, having spent some time working with [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/) while doing WordPress development. I've moved to using [PostgresSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) or [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) in more recent projects. I've also used [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) and [FaunaDB](https://fauna.com/features).

When it comes to working with databases, I absolutely love [Primsa](https://www.prisma.io/). Great docs, great features and full TypeScript support -- what else is there? I've worked with [Mongoose](https://mongoosejs.com/) and [Sequelize](https://sequelize.org/)

## Tools and Other Good Stuff

[Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) is awesome, and I love using it on projects. I've also used [Material UI](https://mui.com/) and [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)/[React Bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/). [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) is a great tool for building and deploying projects while working with a team and different environments. And of course [git](https://git-scm.com/) and [GitHub](https://github.com/) -- two essential tools for working as team.
