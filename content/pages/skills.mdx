When it comes to Front End Development, I love [React](https://reactjs.org/). I started learning it a little over a year ago. It has been nothing short of a breath of fresh air coming from [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/) and [PHP](https://www.php.net/), and I'm enjoying the change of pace.

Over the course of learning React, I've worked with many common tools in the ecosystem. I've built sites with Redux and [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/) and managed routes with [React Router](https://reactrouterdotcom.fly.dev/docs/en/v6). I've built apps that connect with an API, whether that's one I wrote for the app itself or a 3rd party. I've used [fetch](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API/Using_Fetch), [axios](https://axios-http.com/) and [React Query](https://react-query.tanstack.com/).

Like, I image, most of us who have learned React somewhat recently I started with [create-react-app](https://create-react-app.dev/). With later projects I've worked with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and [Remix](https://remix.run/). Using both I've explored Server Side Rendering and Static Site Generation (this site was build with Next.js and SSG).

My most recent projects are written in [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/). I regret not learning TypeScript sooner, but I am definitely enjoying the challenge and the results of working with TS over plain JS.

## APIs and Backend

APIs and Serverless Functions are the backbone of React apps, letting them perform their magic. Whether it is a full Node and Express based API, Serverless Functions or testing with Postman, I can work with APIs and tailor them to the project needs.

## Databases

SQL based databases are definitely more my bread and butter, having spent some time working with MySQL while doing WordPress development. I've moved to using PostgresSQL in most projects. I used MongoDB, Firebase and even FaunaDB on projects.

## Tools and Other Good Stuff

Tailwind CSS is awesome, and I love using it on projects. I've also used Material UI and Bootstrap/React Bootstrap. I've been learning TypeScript, and in fact this site was by first foray into using Ts on a project. Docker is a great tool for building and deploying projects while working with a team and different environments.
