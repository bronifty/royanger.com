I am currently a Full Stack Web Developer, coming from a background of working freelance with some businesses on their WordPress sites.

Thanks for taking a moment to visit! I'm a Full Stack Web Developer from Toronto. Recently I've been freelance and remote work, and I'm looking to either continue with the remote work or even transition into a full time in-house position.

I've recently transition into developing with React, NodeJS, Express, Postgres and Mongo. This site marks the switch from using WordPress to using my new, favourite stacks to develop on.

I spent years creating solutions and site for small business and individuals, using WordPress as the basis for their sites. I used premade themes, page builders or even created custom themes depending on the client and their needs.

Over the last six months I have been focusing on learning React,
Node and some of the other technologies involved in the wide
world of full stack development. I come from a WordPress/PHP
background before that, but React and Node are much more fun and
interesting to work with. I've been loving the learning curve and
the switch to Javascript, React and the related technologies.
