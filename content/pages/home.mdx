I'm a Full Stack Web Developer from Toronto, ON. I'a freelancer working with [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/) but my goal is to move into a full time position. I'm aiming for Frontend Development using [React](https://reactjs.org/) or Full Stack Development adding [Node](https://nodejs.dev/) and databases like [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) into the mix.

Take a peek at my [portfolio](/portfolio) or even my [GitHub](https://github.com/royanger) to see the projects I've worked on. On top of React, I've spent time working with and learning things like Static Site Generation and Server Side Rendering, Redux and [Redux Toolkit](https://redux.js.org/), [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and much more.

On top of working with JavaScript, I've been working with [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and using that in my more recent projects.
