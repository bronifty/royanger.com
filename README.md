A new, fully React-based website built to house my portfolio, contact details and blog. The goal was something modern, using the technology stacks I am currently working with and to move away from WordPress.

## Technology Stack

- React
- Sanity - Headless CMS for blog articles
- Next.js - Handling SEO, Static Site Generation and more for the site
- Typescript - First project where I used Typescript from start to finish

## Goals

- Easy to manage blog via Sanity
- Great mobile, tablet and desktop experience
- Great accessibility
- Portfolio showcase
- Light and Dark mode
- Clean and professional
