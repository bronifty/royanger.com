# Tools and Other Good Stuff

Tailwind CSS is awesome, and I love using it on projects. I've also used Material UI and Bootstrap/React Bootstrap. I've been learning TypeScript, and in fact this site was by first foray into using Ts on a project. Docker is a great tool for building and deploying projects while working with a team and different environments.
